# backpack

Inventory management system for school users

This project uses OOP (object oriented programing) and it sucks.
Basic classes to make objects and have them work with each other.
one class for storage (e.g lockers) and another for stationary
(e.g pencils) or really anything you want it to be. You can swap
items from one storage device to the other but you can't take it out.
you also can't fit some storage devices into the other (e.g backpack
in locker). It's a really simple program and is meant to do the
minimum requirements of the project. Maybe on day I'll flesh it out.
